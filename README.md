I don't know how relevant it is, but here is the link for the first monday assignment: Getting Travis to work.

Originally I had made 2 separate GIT projects, with the JavaScript in one, and the JPA in the other, and now I've put them together to uniform it as we're supposed to.

# Monday
This contains the assignment "REST,JPA, Test and CI with our start code" which has been fully completed.
The same project / day also contains the endpoint tests for the tuesday assignment. 
These are placed under the "test" package.

# Wednesday
This contains the assignments "The JavaScript Array" and "JavaScript Day-1".
In "The JavaScript Array" all assignments except number "K", which is marked red, have been completed.
In "JavaScript Day-1" all assignments except number "4a", which is marked yellow, have been completed. There is a note in the code.

# Thursday
