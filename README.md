I don't know how relevant it is, but here is the link for the first monday assignment: Getting Travis to work.
https://github.com/KumaSudosa/3semWeek7Travis
It's possible we had to provide both links (for both assignments), but I made them in the same repo.

And here is my server link: https://marcuscph.company/Week7Monday/

# Monday
This contains the assignment "REST,JPA, Test and CI with our start code" which has been fully completed.
The same project / day also contains the endpoint tests for the tuesday assignment. 
These are placed under the "test" package.

# Wednesday
This contains the assignments "The JavaScript Array" and "JavaScript Day-1".
In "The JavaScript Array" all assignments except number "K", which is marked red, have been completed.
In "JavaScript Day-1" all assignments except number "4a", which is marked yellow, have been completed. There is a note in the code.

# Thursday 
This contains all the assignments in the "Dom Manipulation and Events" document, but the "Dynamic UI manipulation using data obtained via fetch" assignment has not been completed, and it is marked yellow-red.

# Unfortunately I was unable to complete the friday assignment
